# Used Car Prices

A final project for DTSA-5509, Supervised Learning. The goal for this project is to use a dataset of used car listings gathered to predict the price of a vehicle before listing it for sale.

For this dataset, I am going to explore using simple linear regression and multi-linear regression for price prediction. I suspect the multi-linear regression will give the best results due to how dependant year, make, and model are when considering the price of a vehicle along with other features like the odometer reading.
